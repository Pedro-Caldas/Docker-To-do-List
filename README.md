# Docker To-do List

## Introduction
This project combines Front-end and Back-end, based on a To-do List React application previously created by Trybe. The goal was to containerize and orchestrate it by creating different `dockerfiles` with `images` and `docker-compose.yml` files.

## Main used technologies:
Docker

Docker Compose

## Instructions to utilize the application
To use the application, you will need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) installed.

After cloning the repository, run `npm install` to install the dependencies. You need to use the command `docker-compose up -d` to create and start the container. The command must be done via terminal in the directory where the `docker-compose.yml` file is.

You can use the `npm start` command to display the application page.
